        I am a Passionate Website Developer focusing on Javascript stack. I am a
        hard worker and a fast learner. As a self-taught programmer, I required
        to be flexible to learn new things and always open with new technology
        stack. I'm looking for an opportunity to become a part of a team where I
        can leverage my current skills and continue to grow as a web developer.{" "}
